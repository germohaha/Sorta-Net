GIL mutex explaination
The GIL allows only one thread to execute Python code at a time, even if you have multiple threads running in parallel. 
This is critical to understand when dealing with operations like:
I/O-bound operations 
CPU-bound operations 

The goal here is to use time.time() to measure how long each section of the code takes to execute,
helping understand how thread parallelism behaves with Pythonâ€™s GIL during network-based I/O operations.
